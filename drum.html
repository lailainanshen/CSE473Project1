        <h2>Drum Synthesis</h2>
<p>Most synthesis systems treat drums separately because they work very 
differently.&nbsp; In this component you are required to generate sounds for a 
basic drum kit consisting of (as a minimum):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bass drum</li>
  <li>Snare drum</li>
  <li>2 or more Toms</li>
  <li>Cymbals</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest solution for drum synthesis is to have wavetables for each sound 
and play them back on demand.&nbsp; Other options include using noise (random 
numbers) and filtering or adding a lot of sine waves to build up the sound.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A basic solution for this component will consist of this.&nbsp; To get full 
credit you must <span class="style1">completely synthesize at least one drum</span>.</p>
<p>Elements of a drum synthesizer:</p>
<h3>Polyphony</h3>
<p>Polyphony simply means playing more than one note at a time.&nbsp; When you 
strum a guitar, you are playing six notes at a time.&nbsp; Polyphony means being 
able to start and stop more than one note at the same time.</p>
<h3>Envelope generation</h3>
<p>How an instrument starts the sound and sustains it varies, but usually has a 
volume characteristic to it.&nbsp; An example, a violin may slowly start the 
sound of a note or quickly start it for different songs.&nbsp; This is called an 
&quot;attack&quot;.&nbsp; Many instruments have a rapid decay after the attack, then 
sustain at another level, only to gradually decay at the end.&nbsp; In all cases 
for a wavetable synthesis component you will need to be able to fade the sound 
at the end over several milliseconds to avoid a &quot;pop&quot;.&nbsp; Envelopes 
can significantly change the sound of drums.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a good article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)#ADSR">
ADSR envelopes </a>and we will discuss them in class.</p>
<h2>Synthesis options</h2>
<p>If you want to synthesize a drum sound, you can generate a combination of 
noise and some pitch and then filter that through a phaser and you can make 
pretty cool techno drum sounds.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Noise generation</h3>
<p>Simple use random numbers to create
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">white noise</a> as a starting 
point for your drum sound.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Swept fundamentals</h3>
<p>It's also common that a sinusoid will also be a component of a drum sound, 
though it tends to be &quot;swept&quot;.&nbsp; When you hit a drum hit, the vibrations 
stretch the head, raising the resonant frequency.&nbsp; As the vibrations 
decrease, the stretch also decreases.&nbsp; Hence, the frequency starts at a 
higher pitch and rapidly decreases in pitch.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Reson</h3>
<p>A Reson is a simple recursive filter that emphasizes a specific frequency.&nbsp; 
It's a simple solution for filtering in this application.&nbsp; Step 4 described the implementation of a 
reson.&nbsp; The instructor can also provide you with additional details for 
this component.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Filter Envelopes</h3>
<p>Interesting filter effects are often created by using the same envelope 
design used for amplitude envelopes to filter parameters.&nbsp; Sweeping the 
filter frequency creates the famous &quot;Moog&quot; sound.&nbsp; Filter 
envelopes really work nicely for drum synthesis.</p>
